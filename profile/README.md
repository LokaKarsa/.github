## üìñ About The Project

**LokaKarsa** (meaning "The People's Intention" in Sanskrit) is a gamified, Duolingo-style learning application dedicated to teaching and preserving the ancient **Javanese script (Aksara Jawa)**. In an era of globalization, unique cultural treasures like Aksara Jawa face the risk of being forgotten. LokaKarsa aims to reverse this trend by making learning **fun, accessible, and engaging** for a new generation of users worldwide.

Born from a passion for the rich heritage centered in places like Surakarta and Yogyakarta, this app transforms a complex writing system into a playful journey of discovery. Our mission is not just to teach a script, but to reignite curiosity and foster a deeper connection to Indonesian culture.

This project was proudly developed for the **GarudaHacks 6.0 Hackathon** under the **"Connecting Culture"** sub-theme, and is designed to be a ready-to-use application.

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture Overview

LokaKarsa adopts a decoupled service architecture, allowing for scalability and efficient team development. The project consists of three main repositories:

1.  **[LokaKarsa Frontend](https://github.com/LokaKarsa/LokaKarsa-FE)** (React.js):

    - The interactive and responsive user interface, built with **React (JSX)**.
    - Communicates directly with the **LokaKarsa Backend API** for user data, learning progress, and gamification.
    - Also communicates directly with the **LokaKarsa ML Model API** for handwriting recognition functionality.

2.  **[LokaKarsa Backend API](https://github.com/LokaKarsa/LokaKarsa-BE)** (Laravel):

    - The main backend API built with **Laravel**.
    - Manages user data, learning progress status, leaderboards, and Javanese script content.
    - Interacts with a **MySQL** database.
    - Acts as an intermediary for some requests to the **LokaKarsa ML Model API**, or allows the frontend to interact directly depending on the use case.

3.  **[LokaKarsa ML Model API](https://github.com/LokaKarsa/LokaKarsa-Model-API)** (Flask):
    - A separate API built with **Flask** to host the **Machine Learning model**.
    - Responsible for **recognizing handwritten Javanese script on a canvas**.
    - Provides an endpoint that can be consumed by both the frontend and backend.
